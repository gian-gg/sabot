## Project Overview

- This repository is a submission for Cebu Hacktoberfest.
- Sabot is a focused, composable platform for peer-to-peer transaction verification: clear transaction lifecycles, invite/accept flows, and structured UI primitives that make the app easy to extend or re-implement.
- Your third-party safety layer for verified, transparent, and scam-free online transactions.

## Highlights

- Purpose-built for auditable P2P transactions and invitation workflows.
- Status-driven transaction lifecycle (pending → active → completed + report states).
- Modular UI primitives (cards, buttons, badges, dialogs) and page layout docs.
- This is a concise overview — full developer docs and local setup are in /docs.

## Contributing

- This repo participates in Cebu Hacktoberfest — small, focused contributions are welcome.
- Follow the structural docs in layout/ before changing page composition.
- Keep changes small and componentized; update docs when structure changes.
- Formatting and hooks are configured (Prettier, Husky, lint-staged).
