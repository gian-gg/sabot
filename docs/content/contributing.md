# Contributing

We welcome contributions! Keep changes small, focused, and well-tested.

Getting started

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch off `main`.
2. Write code, run tests, and format with Prettier.
3. Open a PR with a clear description and link any relevant issues.

Commit messages

- Follow Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, perf, test).
- commitlint is enabled to enforce rules.

Documentation style

- Write clear, action-oriented headings.
- Use code blocks for commands and snippets.
- Keep docs DRY: prefer linking to a single source of truth (e.g., a component file) rather than duplicating code.

Design & assets

- For visual polish, add SVG illustrations to `public/` and reference them from docs.
- Consider adding a small brand section: colors, logo, and fonts under `docs/branding`.
