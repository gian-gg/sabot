## Verification Steps

The verification process consists of six main steps:

### 1. Permission Consent

**Purpose**: Inform users about data collection and obtain explicit consent

**User Experience**:

- Clear explanation of what data will be collected
- Privacy policy disclosure
- Information about data usage and security
- Explicit consent checkbox required

**What Users See**:

- Government ID upload requirement
- Facial biometric scan requirement
- Personal information collection notice
- Data usage and privacy guarantees

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Step: PERMISSION_CONSENT
// Component: PermissionConsent
// Required Action: User must check consent checkbox
```

**Data Collected**: None (consent only)

**Validation**: Consent checkbox must be checked to proceed

---

### 2. ID Selection

**Purpose**: User selects their government-issued ID type

**Supported ID Types**:

- **Passport** - International travel document
- **UMID** (Unified Multi-Purpose ID) - Philippine national ID
- **PhilSys ID** - Philippine Identification System
- **Driver's License** - Philippine driver's license

**User Experience**:

- Clean card-based selection interface
- Clear icons and labels
- Radio button selection
- Helpful descriptions for each ID type

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Step: ID_SELECTION
// Component: IdSelection
// State: selectedIDType (UserIDType)
type UserIDType = {
  type: IdType;
  file: File | null;
};
```

**Validation**: At least one ID type must be selected

---

### 3. ID Capture

**Purpose**: Upload and verify government ID document using AI

### 4. Biometric Capture (Liveness Check)

**Purpose**: Verify user is live person and matches ID photo

**Process Overview**:

1. Camera access requested
2. User performs series of actions
3. Each action captured and verified
4. Face matching against ID photo
5. Liveness detection to prevent spoofing

**Liveness Check Steps**:

**Fixed Steps** (always performed):

- Look straight ahead
- Turn your head to the left
- Turn your head to the right

**Random Steps** (1 randomly selected):

- Smile
- Open your mouth
- Raise your eyebrows
- Close your eyes

Total: 4 steps per verification session

**AI Verification**:

```typescript
// Prototype: For each step, Gemini AI verifies liveness and face matching
// Production: Would use specialized biometric verification systems
const result = await verifyLivenessCheck(
  faceCapture, // Current camera frame
  userIdCard, // Uploaded ID
  stepName // Current instruction
);

// Returns:
interface LivenessCheckResult {
  isLivenessVerified: boolean; // Real person detected
  isFaceMatchVerified: boolean; // Face matches ID
  faceMatchConfidence: number | null; // 0-1 confidence score
  notes: string[]; // Any issues/warnings
}
```

> **Prototype Implementation**: Gemini AI analyzes each captured frame to detect faces, verify liveness based on the requested action, and match against the ID photo. This demonstrates the complete flow and user experience effectively for a hackathon prototype.
>
> **Production Considerations**: Real-world implementation would require:
>
> - Certified liveness detection SDKs (iProov, Onfido, Jumio, etc.)
> - Advanced anti-spoofing measures (3D depth sensing, passive liveness)
> - ISO/IEC 30107-3 compliant liveness detection
> - NIST-certified face matching algorithms
> - Hardware-based security (TEE, secure enclaves)
> - Compliance with biometric data regulations (GDPR, BIPA, etc.)

**User Instructions**:

- Find a well-lit area
- Remove glasses, hats, and masks
- Look straight at the camera
- Follow the on-screen prompts
- Ensure face is inside the frame

**Captured Data**:

```typescript
interface CaptureData extends LivenessCheckResult {
  step: string; // Which action was performed
  timestamp: string; // ISO timestamp
}
```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ All steps completed successfully
- ✅ Face detected in each frame
- ✅ Liveness verified (not a photo/video)
- ✅ Face matches ID photo
- ✅ Confidence score meets threshold

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Step: BIOMETRIC_CAPTURE
// Component: BiometricCapture
// AI Service: verifyLivenessCheck()
// Camera: getUserMedia() API
// Frames: Captured via Canvas API
```

**Privacy & Security**:

- Camera access required only during this step
- Frames processed immediately, not stored long-term
- Face matching done server-side
- Results stored, not raw images
