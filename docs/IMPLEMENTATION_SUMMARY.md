# Implementation Summary - Real-time Transaction Invitation Flow

## Overview

A complete production-ready real-time transaction invitation system has been implemented for the Sabot platform. This system enables two users to synchronize in real-time as they progress through creating, joining, and completing a secure P2P transaction.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema ✅

**Files:**

- `supabase/migrations/001_create_transactions.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/002_create_storage_bucket.sql`

**Features:**

- `transactions` table with status tracking
- `transaction_participants` table (max 2 users per transaction)
- `transaction_screenshots` table for file metadata
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Optimized indexes for query performance
- Helper functions for status checks
- Storage bucket for screenshot uploads

---

### 2. TypeScript Types ✅

**File:** `src/types/transaction.ts`

**Added Types:**

- `DBTransaction` - Database transaction structure
- `TransactionParticipant` - Participant information
- `TransactionScreenshot` - Screenshot metadata
- `TransactionStatusResponse` - API response format
- `CreateTransactionPayload` - Create request payload
- `JoinTransactionPayload` - Join request payload
- `UploadScreenshotPayload` - Upload request payload

---

### 3. API Routes ✅

#### `/api/transaction/create` (POST)

Creates new transaction and adds creator as participant

**Features:**

- Automatic creator participant assignment
- Transaction ID generation
- Invitation URL creation
- Error handling and rollback

#### `/api/transaction/join` (POST)

Adds invitee to transaction

**Features:**

- Validation (max 2 participants, not creator, not duplicate)
- Status update to `both_joined`
- Participant role assignment
- Real-time trigger

#### `/api/transaction/[id]/status` (GET)

Retrieves current transaction status

**Features:**

- Participant list
- Current user role
- `is_ready_for_next_step` flag
- Permission validation

#### `/api/transaction/[id]/upload` (POST)

Handles screenshot uploads

**Features:**

- File validation (type, size)
- Supabase Storage integration
- Participant record update
- Auto-status change when both upload
- Cleanup on error

---

### 4. Real-time Synchronization Hook ✅

**File:** `src/hooks/useTransactionStatus.ts`

**Features:**

- Automatic status fetching
- Supabase Realtime subscription
- Event listening on:
  - `transactions` table changes
  - `transaction_participants` table changes
- Automatic refetch on updates
- Cleanup on unmount
- Error handling

---

### 5. Frontend Components ✅

#### Create Invitation Page

**File:** `src/components/transaction/invite/create-invitation-page.tsx`

**Features:**

- Automatic transaction creation on mount
- Shareable link display with copy button
- Email invitation dialog (ready for integration)
- Real-time participant status monitoring
- Auto-navigation when both users join
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications

**User Experience:**

1. Page loads → Transaction created automatically
2. Link displayed → User copies/shares
3. Waiting indicator → Shows "waiting for other party"
4. Other party joins → Automatic navigation to upload

#### Accept Invitation Page

**File:** `src/components/transaction/invite/accept-invitation-page.tsx`

**Features:**

- Three-step wizard (Review → Upload → Verification)
- API integration for joining transaction
- File upload with FormData
- Real-time status synchronization
- Auto-navigation when ready
- Progress indicator
- Error recovery

**User Experience:**

1. Opens link → Reviews invitation details
2. Clicks accept → Joins transaction
3. Both joined → Moves to upload step
4. Uploads screenshot → Shows verification
5. Both uploaded → Navigates to transaction details

---

## Key Technical Features

### Real-time Synchronization

- **Supabase Realtime** channels for instant updates
- **Automatic navigation** when conditions met
- **Bi-directional sync** between creator and invitee
- **No polling required** - event-driven architecture

### Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** on all tables
- **Authentication required** for all operations
- **Permission checks** in API routes
- **File validation** on uploads
- **Private storage bucket** with access policies

### User Experience

- **Loading states** throughout the flow
- **Toast notifications** for feedback
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Automatic transitions** between steps
- **Real-time progress indicators**

### Performance

- **Database indexes** for fast queries
- **Optimized subscriptions** with filters
- **Efficient file uploads** with size limits
- **Cleanup on unmount** to prevent memory leaks

---

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **User A creates transaction**

   ```
   Component mounts → API call → Transaction created → Link displayed
   ```

2. **User A shares link**

   ```
   Copy to clipboard OR Send via email (TODO)
   ```

3. **User B opens link**

   ```
   Accept page loads → Shows invitation details → User clicks accept
   ```

4. **User B joins**

   ```
   API call → Participant added → Realtime event fired
   ```

5. **Both users synchronized**

   ```
   Realtime subscription detects change → Both navigate to upload
   ```

6. **Both users upload**

   ```
   File → FormData → Storage → Database → Status update
   ```

7. **Both proceed**
   ```
   Realtime detects both uploaded → Both navigate to details
   ```
