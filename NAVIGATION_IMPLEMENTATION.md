# Navigation Menu Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive navigation menu system with dropdown menus for Product and Company sections that can be accessed from the homepage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Footer Updates (`src/components/core/footer.tsx`)

- **Renamed "Pricing" to "Tokens"**: Changed the link from `#pricing` to `#tokens`
- **Renamed "Careers" to "Arbiter"**: Changed the link from `#careers` to `#arbiter`

### 2. New Navigation Menu Component (`src/components/core/navigation-menu.tsx`)

Created a new navigation menu component with dropdown menus featuring:

#### Product Dropdown

- **Features** - Discover how Sabot protects your transactions
- **How It Works** - Learn about our verification process
- **Reports** - View transaction reports and analytics
- **Documentation** - API docs and integration guides
- **Tokens** - Token pricing and packages

#### Company Dropdown

- **About Us** - Our mission to make transactions safer
- **Blog** - Latest news and insights
- **Arbiter** - Join our team as a dispute arbiter
- **Careers** - Work with us to build safer marketplaces
- **Contact** - Get in touch with our team

#### Features

- Icon-based visual navigation
- Descriptive text for each menu item
- Hover states and smooth transitions
- Responsive design (hidden on mobile, shown on md+ screens)
- Uses shadcn/ui NavigationMenu component

### 3. Header Integration (`src/components/core/header.tsx`)

- Added navigation menu between logo and header action
- Positioned centrally in the header
- Hidden on mobile screens (responsive: `hidden md:flex`)
- Maintains the existing mouse-reactive border effect

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added

- `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu` (via shadcn/ui)
- Navigation menu component from shadcn/ui

### Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS classes
- Follows existing design system (primary colors, hover states)
- Consistent with Sabot's safety-first aesthetic
- Icons from `lucide-react`

### Route Structure

All navigation links use:

- Hash links for on-page sections (`#features`, `#how-it-works`, etc.)
- Route constants from `@/constants/routes` for full page routes
- Maintains consistency with existing routing patterns

## Usage

The navigation menu is automatically displayed in the header on all pages that use the `<Header />` component. Users can:

1. Hover over "Product" or "Company" to see dropdown menus
2. Click any menu item to navigate to that section/page
3. See icons and descriptions for each option
4. Use keyboard navigation for accessibility

## Future Enhancements

- Add mobile menu (hamburger) for responsive navigation
- Implement scroll-to-section functionality for hash links
- Add active state indicators for current page/section
- Consider adding mega-menu layout for more content
