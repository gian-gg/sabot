### Layout Structure

Each page follows consistent structure:

1. Hero section with badge, title, description
2. Multiple content sections with IDs for anchor linking
3. Card-based content display
4. CTA (Call-to-Action) section at bottom
5. Responsive grid layouts (1/2/3 columns)

### Navigation Integration

Updated both footer and navigation menu to link to new pages:

- Footer links point to `/product#section`, `/company#section`, `/tokens`
- Navigation dropdown menu items use same routing
- All links use proper Next.js Link components

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure

```

├── product/
│   └── page.tsx
